        <p id="first_paragraph">Today is the first day I am writing on my coding adventures.  As you can tell by the basic look of this page I am new at this. I am documenting this exciting day because:
        <ol>
        <li id="first_post1">It is part of the assignment to test my knowlege of the content I am learning through the Khan Academy Course and through outside research</li>  
        <li id="first_post2">It is important to take time to celebrate successes to ensure I keep going. I learned a long time ago that I can focus on the struggle and not the small victories so it is important that I recognize the positives. So far, I have been putting in the time to learn on top of working full-time and making sure I am spending quality time with my two amazing kids. </li></ol>
        <h2 id="how">How did I get here?</h2>
    <p> I have wanted to learn to program since my senior year in high school when I took a class that taught us how to build a duck shooting game. I took one sophomore level computer science class my freshman year that was way over my head and left me feeling like it was not a realstic path for me.  Why I took a year two course still escapes me.
    I have spent the last 15 years working in risk and occupational health and safety.  During the pandemic I was working with front line medical staff.  I had a number of close calls  working with staff that had unprotected exposures to COVD positive patients. As such I had to self-quarantine for two weeks to ensure that if I had been exposed, I was not exposing my family.  I couldn't even have my dog with me. So killing time I started a tutorial on animating with code.  I loved it! So here I am today learning more!
        <h2 id="whats_to_come">What's to come...</h2>
   <p>More learning, more making <strong>mistakes</strong> and <strong>learning</strong> from them. Maybe once I feel I have the basics I will invest in myself and enroll in a bootcamp.  Who knows?   </p>
